Nothing to see for now. The "wild" idea is just to build a common toolkit for building static sites for a variety of domains. For example building a blog would use `$ static-blog`, docs `$ static-docs`, while a photo gallery would be `$ static-gallery`. Focusing UX on each domain as needed, so you're not fighting a framework built for creating blogs – if none of these tools fit your needs, then just use the shared tooling to build your own.
